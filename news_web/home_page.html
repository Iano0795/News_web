        <p>The phrase “gray hat hacker” has been quite controversial.
            To some, it means a hacker who occasionally breaks the law
            or does something unethical to reach a desired end. We, as
            gray hat hackers, reject that notion. In a moment we will
            give our definition. We have read more than one book that
            has further confused the meaning of the phrase and have
            come to recognize that the authors of those books just don’t
            know any better and would not consider themselves gray
            hat hackers because they don’t understand who we are, so
            they attempt to denigrate our group. Therefore, as the
            authors of the founding book on this topic, let us set the
            record straight.
            History of Hacking
            Ethical hacking has not always been accepted as a legal
            profession. There was a time when any form of hacking,
            regardless of the intent, was regarded as a purely criminal
            exercise. As technology has evolved and become more
            pervasive in our lives, so have the understanding of hacking
            and the laws that govern its use. For many of the readers of
            this book, these are concepts that are simply lost to history.
            However, it is important to understand this history and give
            credit to the hard work of the founders of the field who
            made it possible to pursue this career. We provide this
            information not only to inform but also to protect the ability
            of professionals to apply their hacking skills ethically so that
            they may continue to make the world a better place.
            There was a time when fewer rules governed the use of
            computers because the skills and knowledge of lawmakers
            and law enforcement lagged during the rapid evolution of
            networked systems. Hackers who might attack systems out
            of curiosity or even mischief, however, had found a new
            world of opportunity. Not everyone indulging their curiosity
            did so without harm. However, the resulting clash with
            authority figures who were unable to understand the
            systems meant many benevolent, bright and intelligent
            hackers were labeled as criminals by much of the world’s
            software vendors and governments, regardless of their
            intent. You see, people are afraid of what they do not
            understand, and many will only understand that a hacker
            broke into a system without permission—not that they
            intended no harm when doing so
            In 1986 the United States passed the Computer Fraud and
            Abuse Act to shore up existing computer fraud laws. This
            expressly prohibited access to computing systems without
            authorization, or in excess of authorization, and was
            designed to protect critical government systems. Shortly
            thereafter, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was
            released in 1988. This criminalized attacks against access
            control or digital rights management (DRM). In a time when
            computer hacking was not only misunderstood, but feared,
            the resulting environment for security researchers could be
            very hostile. Legitimate researchers in the hacking
            community were now left to fear that finding vulnerabilities
            and reporting them could result in legal action or even jail
            time, according to one or both of these acts, given the
            argument that code was copyrighted and reverse
            engineering was therefore illegal, or that unauthorized
            access to any system (not only government systems) must
            be criminal 
            This still happens some places
            Increased pressure for hackers to distinguish themselves
            from criminals led many researchers to define for
            themselves a set of ethics that could bring no legal
            question, while others questioned the chilling effect of the
            law and the overall reaction to security research. Those in
            the first camp became known as “white hat hackers,”
            choosing to discuss known weaknesses with only the
            minimum amount of detail possible in order to try to get
            things fixed. These hackers also chose to eschew techniques
            that might possibly cause harm during their research and to
            only perform actions that involved full permission. This left
            the rest to be marked as “black hat hackers,” for anyone
            who might question the goodness of the law.
            Yet, a third group emerged. Hackers who desired not to do
            harm but to make things better found themselves frustrated
            by the inability to make positive change in face of these
            limitations. Where were the laws to hold software makers
            and providers accountable for security decisions that
            negatively impacted consumers? Discovery of vulnerabilities
            had not stopped; it had simply been forced underground,
            while white hat techniques remained hampered in what they
            were able to discover by legal limitations on their methods.
            For some subset of hackers, it was not all about following
            the rules, but it was not about personal gain or causing
            harm, either.
            The phrase “gray hat hacking” was first mentioned by
            Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, in 1997, in the first Black Hat
            proceedings,1
             when he announced that he would start
            working with Microsoft to resolve vulnerabilities.2
